## 📋 Netlify Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab**
2. **Ensure these files are in your repository:**
   - `package.json`
   - `vite.config.ts`
   - `index.html`
   - All source files in `src/`
   - Team photos in `public/` folder

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect your repository**
4. **Set build settings:**
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - **Node version:** 18 (or latest LTS)

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional)
If you want to use environment variables for API keys:
1. **Go to Site settings > Environment variables**
2. **Add:** `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` = `AIzaSyAMWFagqRGqiRQ726YDoZr8VDbqxMXrLAc`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. **API Key Security**

- **Solution:** Add `team-member-3.jpg` to `public/` folder
- **Current Status:** ✅ Using default placeholder

### 3. **Browser Compatibility**
