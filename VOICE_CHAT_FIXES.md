# Voice Chatbot Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Simulated Speech Recognition Replaced with Real Web Speech API**
- **Before**: The chatbot was using a hardcoded simulated response: `"I am feeling a bit lonely today"`
- **After**: Now uses the actual Web Speech API to capture real user voice input

### 2. **Dynamic AI Responses Based on User Input**
- **Before**: AI responses were generic and didn't change based on what the user said
- **After**: AI responses are now generated dynamically using the Gemini API with context-aware prompts

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added proper error handling for speech recognition failures
- Added fallback responses when the API is unavailable
- Added browser compatibility checks

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Real Speech Recognition Implementation**
```typescript
// Initialize Speech Recognition
useEffect(() => {
  if ('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window || 'SpeechRecognition' in window) {
    const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
    recognitionRef.current = new SpeechRecognition();
    recognitionRef.current.continuous = false;
    recognitionRef.current.interimResults = false;
    recognitionRef.current.lang = 'en-US';
    
    // Event handlers for real speech recognition
    recognitionRef.current.onresult = (event: any) => {
      const transcript = Array.from(event.results)
        .map((result: any) => result[0])
        .map(result => result.transcript)
        .join('');
      
      // Process real user input
      generateAIResponse(transcript);
    };
  }
}, []);
```

### 2. **Context-Aware AI Responses**
```typescript
const generateAIResponse = async (userInput: string) => {
  // Create a context-aware prompt
  const contextPrompt = `You are ${selectedAvatar.name}, an AI companion with the personality: ${selectedAvatar.personality}. 
  
  The user just said: "${userInput}"
  
  Please respond as ${selectedAvatar.name} in a conversational, supportive, and empathetic way. Keep your response natural and helpful, as if you're having a real conversation. Don't be too formal or robotic.`;
  
  const result = await model.generateContent(contextPrompt);
  const response = await result.response;
  const text = response.text();
  
  // Add dynamic response to chat
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
    id: (Date.now() + 1).toString(),
    text: text,
    sender: 'bot',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    isVoice: true
  }]);
};
```

### 3. **Enhanced Fallback Responses**
- Added more specific fallback responses for different types of user input
- Responses now include the avatar's name and personality
- Better handling of common conversation patterns

### 4. **TypeScript Support**
- Added `src/types/speech.d.ts` for proper Web Speech API type definitions
- Ensures type safety and better IDE support

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to the page**: http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy)
3. **Click "Start Talking"** in the hero section
4. **Select an avatar** from the avatar selection screen
5. **Click "Start Talking"** in the voice chatbot
6. **Speak clearly** into your microphone
7. **Wait for the AI response** - it should now be dynamic based on what you said

## Browser Compatibility

The voice chatbot now works in browsers that support the Web Speech API:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium browsers
- ✅ Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Safari (limited support)
- ❌ Firefox (doesn't support Web Speech API)

## Troubleshooting

If speech recognition doesn't work:
1. Make sure you're using a supported browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Allow microphone permissions when prompted
3. Speak clearly and at a normal volume
4. Check the browser console for any error messages

## Next Steps

The voice chatbot now:
- ✅ Captures real user voice input
- ✅ Generates dynamic AI responses based on user input
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Provides fallback responses when needed

The system is now fully functional for voice-based conversations with dynamic responses!
