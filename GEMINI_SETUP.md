# 🚀 Gemini Chatbot Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Already Done

Your chatbot is already integrated into your React app! Here's what's been set up:

- ✅ Chatbot component created (`src/components/Chatbot.tsx`)
- ✅ Component added to your main App (`src/App.tsx`)
- ✅ Dependencies installed (`@google/generative-ai`)
- ✅ Vite configuration updated
- ✅ Test script created

## 🔑 Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. **Visit Google AI Studio:**
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create API Key:**
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Choose "Create API Key in new project" or select existing project
   - Copy the generated API key (it looks like: `AIzaSyC...`)

## 🔧 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env` file** in your project root (same level as `package.json`):
   ```bash
   # Create the file
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Add your API key** to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   ⚠️ **Important:** Replace `AIzaSyC_your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual API key!

## 🧪 Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Test API Connection:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:chatbot
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and look for the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner

## 🎯 Step 4: Using the Chatbot

1. **Open Chatbot:** Click the blue chat bubble icon in the bottom-right corner
2. **Start Chatting:** Type your message and press Enter
3. **Minimize:** Click the minimize button to collapse the chat window
4. **Close:** Click the X button to close the chatbot

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "API key not found" error
- Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root
- Verify the API key is correct (starts with `AIzaSyC`)
- Restart your development server after adding the `.env` file

### ❌ "Network error" or "API connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Make sure you haven't exceeded API quotas

### ❌ Chatbot not appearing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the Chatbot component is imported in `App.tsx`
- Make sure all dependencies are installed

### ❌ TypeScript errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that `@google/generative-ai` is in your `package.json`

## 🎨 Customization Options

The chatbot is fully customizable! You can modify:

- **Styling:** Edit the CSS classes in `Chatbot.tsx`
- **Position:** Change the `fixed bottom-4 right-4` classes
- **Welcome Message:** Modify the initial message in the `useState`
- **Model:** Change from `gemini-pro` to other Gemini models

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file to git
- ⚠️ The API key is exposed in the client-side code (for demo purposes)
- 🔒 For production, implement server-side API calls
